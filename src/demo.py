        Welcome to BYOTA's demo!

        This small Web application shows some of the things you could do running BYOTA's code on your own timeline.
        As this is open for anyone to use, this version of the code does not connect to any real social network, but uses either synthetic data (to simulate posts in the home, local, and public timelines) or posts from [my Mastodon account](http://fosstodon.org/@mala).

        If you want to use BYOTA with your own data, feel free to check its [⌨️ code](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/byota)
        and [📖 documentation](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/byota/).

        So, feel free to just click "submit" in the following Configuration form and... see what happens!
