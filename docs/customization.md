# 🎨 **Customization Guide**

This Blueprint is designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to your specific needs. This guide will walk you through some key areas you can customize to make the Blueprint your own.

---

## 🧠 **Changing Embedding Model / Engine**

- run a different llamafile
- run a different model with ollama

## 📝 **Using a different data source**

... Why not Bluesky, different mastodon instances, RSS feeds?


## 💡 Other Customization Ideas

- use different data: why just text? What can we do with e.g. images?
- use different algorithms: what can we run locally and how much compute do we need for that? Can we train a model for e.g. classification on top of the embeddings?
